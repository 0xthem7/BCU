    <div class="stuff1">
        Machine learning is a subset of AI, which enables the machine to automatically learn from data, improve performance from past
        experiences, and make predictions. Machine learning contains a set of algorithms that work on a huge amount of data. Data is fed 
        to these algorithms to train them, and on the basis of training, they build the model & perform a specific task.

        <p class="basedOn">Based on the methods and way of learning, machine learning is divided into mainly four types, which are:</p>
        <ol class="list1">
            <li>Supervised Machine Learning</li>
            <li>Unsupervised Machine Learning</li>
            <li>Semi-Supervised Machine Learning</li>

        <div class="stuff3Sec1">
            <p>As its name suggests, Supervised Machine Learning is based on supervision.
                It means in the supervised learning technique, we train the machines using the "labeled" dataset, 
                and based on the training, the machine predicts the output. Here, the labeled data specifies that some 
                of the inputs are already mapped to the output. More preciously, we can say; first, we train the machine with
                 the input and corresponding output, and then we ask the machine to predict the output using the test dataset.</p>

        <div class="stuff3Sec2">
          <p>Categories of Supervised Machine Learning</p>
          <p>Supervised machine learning can be classified into two types of problems, which are given below:</p>
          <ul class="cat">
            <li>Classification</li>

        <div class="stuff3sec1">
            <p>
                Unsupervised Machine Learning  is different from the Supervised learning technique;
                as its name suggests, there is no need for supervision. It means, in unsupervised machine learning, the machine is trained using
                the unlabeled dataset, and the machine predicts the output without any supervision.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="stuff3sec2">
            <p>
                The main aim of the unsupervised learning algorithm is to group or categories the 
                unsorted dataset according to the similarities, patterns, and differences.

               <p>Unsupervised Learning can be further classified into two types, which are given below:</p>
                <ul class="cat">

            3. Semi-Supervised Learning
        </p>
        <p class="stuff4sec1">
            Semi-Supervised learning is a type of Machine Learning algorithm that lies between Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning. It represents the intermediate 
            ground between Supervised (With Labelled training data) and Unsupervised learning (with no labelled training data) algorithms and uses the combination of labelled and unlabeled datasets during the training period.
        </p>
        <p class="stuff4sec2">
            To overcome the drawbacks of supervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithms, the concept of Semi-supervised learning is introduced. The main aim of semi-supervised learning is to effectively use all the available data, rather than only labelled data like in supervised learning.

        <p class="reinforcement">
            4. Reinforcement Learning
        </p>
        <p class="stuff5sec1">
            Reinforcement learning works on a feedback-based process, in which an AI agent (A software component) automatically explore its surrounding by hitting & trail, taking action, learning from experiences, and improving its performance. Agent gets rewarded for each good action and get punished for each bad action; hence the goal of reinforcement learning agent is to maximize the rewards.
        </p>
        <p class="stuff5sec2">
            Due to its way of working, reinforcement learning is employed in different fields such as Game theory, Operation Research, Information theory, multi-agent systems.
        </p>
        <p class="stuff5sec3">
            Categories of Reinforcement Learning
            Reinforcement learning is categorized mainly into two types of methods/algorithms:
        </p>
        <ul class="cat1">
            <li>Negative Reinforcement Learning: Negative reinforcement learning works exactly opposite to the positive RL. It increases the tendency that the specific behaviour would occur again by avoiding the negative condition.</li> 
            <li>Positive Reinforcement Learning: Positive reinforcement learning specifies increasing the tendency that the required behaviour would occur again by adding something. It enhances the strength of the behaviour of the agent and positively impacts it.</li> 
        </ul>
