* Data Structure - How data is represented
* Algorithm - How data is operated

Data structure is a way of `organizing` and `storing` data in computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
* It depends upon Time and Space complexity

Data are represented as binary in computers

Binary are used to store data for following reason
* Computer works on transistor so the data can be managed as weather it on or off
* On can be represented as __1__ and Off can be represented as __2__ 
* With laser technology light can reflect in two different directions.

Compiling all the statements binary is used since it can be represented as (1 or 0)


**Question**
* How do we use binary to represent the value we want to store?
* How many switches (bits) do we need to represent this data type?


### Representing integers in bits

* Tally scheme - The number represented by a sequence 10011011 is simple 5 since it has __5 (1 bits)__
* Base 2 representation - The number is sum of the value of bits i.e. the right most bit is 1 the left one is 2 and 3, 8 ....  so (01001100) mean 64 + 8 + 4 =76 


#### Number system
