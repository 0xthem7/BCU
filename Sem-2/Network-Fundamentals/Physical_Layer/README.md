# Physical Layer

* Transmission of frames requires the following physical layer elements 
    * Physical media and associated connectors, wired or wireless
    * Representation of bits on the media 
    * Encoding of data and control information
    * Transmitter and receiver circuitry (collection of circuits)

## Physical Layer Media
* Transmission media can be devided into two categories
    * Guided
    * Unguided 

## Physical Layer standard 
* Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Datalink
    * TCP/IP standards are implemented in software and governed by IETF

## Fundamental Principles of Layer 1
1. Physical components : fibre, UTP, Coaxial, NIC
2. Data encodings : NRZ, Manchester, 4B/5B
3. Signalling : Amplitude, frequency, phase 

## Bandwidth
* Amount of imformation that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Measured in Kilobits per second (Kbps) or Megabits per seconds (Mbps)


Bits per seconds         - 1 bps  - fundamental unit of bandwidth
Kilobits per seconds     - 1 kbps - 1,000 bps - 10^3 bps
Megabits per seconds     - 1 Mbps - 1,000,000 bps - 10^6 bps
Gigabits per seconds     - 1 Gbps - 1,000,000,000 bps - 10^9 bps
Terabits per seconfs     - 1 Tbps - 1,000,000,000,000 bps - 10^12 bps

## Latency and Throguht

* Latency : Amount of time including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another
P1 <--> 10 ms Delay  []   <-->  [] <--> P2 

* Throughput : Measure of the transfer bits across the media over a given period of time. 
* Goodput : It is minus traffic overhead
Goodput is always lower than throughput, which is generally lower than bandwidth
