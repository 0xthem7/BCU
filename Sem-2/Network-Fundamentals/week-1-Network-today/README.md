# Network Types

* Home Networks: A group of devices - such as computers, game systems, printers, and mobile devices - that connected to the Internet and each other.
* Small office and home office (SOHO): It allows computers in a home office or remote office to connect to a corporate network, or access centralized, shared resources
* Businesses and large organizations: use networks to provide storage, and access to information on network servers. Provide email, instant messaging, and collaboration among employees. 
* The Internet: It is a worldwide system of computer networks. Also known as "the Net"

# LANS and WANS
* LAN : a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home
* WAN : the technology that connects your offices, data centers, cloud applications, and cloud storage together
